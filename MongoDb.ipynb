    "Q1. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that stores data in a flexible, document-based format using BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, making it highly scalable and suitable for modern applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular structure found in SQL databases. Instead, they use various data models like key-value, document-based, column-family, or graph-based models. NoSQL databases are preferred in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema: The data structure can change over time, and each record does not need to have a fixed set of columns like in SQL databases.\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: NoSQL databases can easily scale out by adding more servers, which makes them suitable for handling large amounts of data and high-traffic applications.\n",
    "Rapid development: They allow developers to start working without worrying about database schema design, making the development process faster.\n",
    "Complex data types: NoSQL databases can handle complex, nested data structures like arrays and sub-documents efficiently.\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data and Real-time Analytics: MongoDB's ability to scale horizontally and handle large volumes of data makes it suitable for big data processing and real-time analytics.\n",
    "Content Management Systems: CMS platforms often deal with semi-structured data, where the data schema can change frequently. MongoDB's flexible schema fits well in such cases.\n",
    "Internet of Things (IoT) Applications: IoT devices generate a massive amount of data that needs to be stored and processed in a flexible manner, making MongoDB a good choice.\n",
